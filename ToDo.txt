How to deal with Wine
Stoke levels and stock take records should show bottles
(sm, Me, Lg doesn't work here)
Number of bottles used = (smallx125 + largex250 + medx175)/750 - rounded up to nearest whole number
Don't need to set cost on individual glasses - we work that out against bottles /cartons.
You can also sell a bottle of wine....
Could put id of juice, bottles of wine in settings.php
Per event avarage to total sales if in event-type view
